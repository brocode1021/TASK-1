# TASK-1
# My Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website I built to share a little about myself and my work. It's a simple, clean, one-page site made with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript.

## What's Inside

The portfolio includes a few key sections:

*   **About Me:** A brief introduction.
*   **Skills:** A look at the technologies I work with.
*   **Projects:** A place to show some of the projects I'm proud of.
*   **Contact Form:** An easy way for people to get in touch.

## Special Touches

I wanted to make the site enjoyable to browse, so I added a few extra details:

*   **Light & Dark Theme:** You can switch between a light and dark look.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The site looks good on desktops, tablets, and phones.
*   **Smooth Experience:** I added smooth scrolling and simple hover effects for a nice feel.

## Made With

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript
